### `📝 How to Play? 📝`

* You needa collect all the wastes in the correct trash, how more correct wastes you catch, more points you get.

* You have three hearts and the game ends when you miss all of them. For each wrong waste you catch, one heart is missed.

* If you click the left mouse button, your trash change the color and your correct wastes will change too.

* There are three dificulty levels available to play: Easy, Medium and Hard. For each, you have more kinda trashes to use, for example:

```
- Easy Level: 4 trashes (plastic, metal, paper and glass)
- Medium Level: 7 trashes (plastic, metal, paper, glass, dangerous, non-recyclable, organic)
